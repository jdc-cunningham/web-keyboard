Okay I'm going to work on a standard layout now

the other positive of a standard layout keyboard is the automatic scaling

3:52 PM

ugh... the object key order is not honored dang

4:12 PM

Okay so I have a rendered keyboard, not all the keys are the right size, so honing that in

Desinging around this 13" 4K display

Although how big is my browser says 2194px wide

4:21 PM

ehh... I don't really like the sizing but it works as a keyboard

need to eat

4:29 PM

alright back on, need to test shift

dang I'm tired... woke up and didn't sleep much

always workin... slavin'... everyday...

going to work on this, started designing the layout, it's like one of those ergonomic keyboards but worse

10:20 AM

my fingers rest naturally like this

<img src="./keyboard-layout.png"/>

Designed on a 13" foldable laptop to tablet eg. Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 4K

10:26 AM

My plan is to store the key position/rotations and then render them, double function in object lookup

I'm not interested in a full keyboard experience, just the major stuff, it's mostly for writing but supports code writing too (symbols)

The reason I'm making this is currently my Chromebook running Manjaro Linux won't trigger a keyboard while in tablet mode so I'll have this keyboard built into my web app.

my scuffed alignment view

11:58 AM

this project may have a flaw already, single clicks

maybe it's not noticeable but so far I'm noticing it lol even with just two keys

12:19 PM

losing steam, feeling of dread in my mind

12:22 PM

THEY KILLED MY WIFE AND MY BABY!!! (Megadeth)

ugh man whatever

12:25 PM

hmm... the rapid clicks moves windows around/interpretted as gestures

12:41 PM

this is kind of fun making an interface, I want to add a sound to it too

ugh... but the rapid typing triggers some gesture (minimizes chromium)

1:03 PM

lol wtf is this

<img src="wtf-keyboard.png"/>

1:11 PM

I just realized there's no room for the numbers... so I'll go for a toggle to show a row of numbers

1:31 PM

I think the keys are a tad too big :(

1:43 PM

oh man this keyboard is scuffed

1:57 PM

back on quick snack break

2:17 PM

I have to make the largest dimension a little smaller/shift things around

I think sicne backspace is on the same line as numbers, I will just add the numbers

<img src="./pre-down-scale.png"/>

It's funny I might have to sell this laptop for money anyway lol

Despite designing apps around it

ASTRA man... I'm down 80% on that lol

2:20 PM

this is going to suck this down scale

2:37 PM

generally it's 10% down, 2% across

2:40 PM

cat distraction

3:18 PM

it might be defeat but I may just build a conventional design in order to get this done soon

3:38 PM

distracted, plugged in an external monitor to speed it up, was switching virtual desktops

3:43 PM

It is arguable it would be easier to use flex to design this keyboard vs. manual positioning

However I was initially trying to do the ergonomic style

6:18 PM

got some good news... offer in the works, light on the hill (damn throw back)

I just realzied this keyboard is aligned with the bottom right of the container ugh... gotta shift it again

I'm pretty spent right now, didn't sleep well today

6:24 PM

feeling slow, lost the drive, hungry

I've got like 3 weeks off still lol... on the down side I'm broke... I might have to sell more things

6:32 PM

this isn't happening... I'll pick it up tomorrow
