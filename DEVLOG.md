dang I'm tired... woke up and didn't sleep much

always workin... slavin'... everyday...

going to work on this, started designing the layout, it's like one of those ergonomic keyboards but worse

10:20 AM

my fingers rest naturally like this

Designed on a 13" foldable laptop to tablet eg. Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 4K

10:26 AM

My plan is to store the key position/rotations and then render them, double function in object lookup

I'm not interested in a full keyboard experience, just the major stuff, it's mostly for writing but supports code writing too (symbols)

The reason I'm making this is currently my Chromebook running Manjaro Linux won't trigger a keyboard while in tablet mode so I'll have this keyboard built into my web app.
